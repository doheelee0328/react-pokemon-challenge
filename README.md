## Pokedex App
Challenge in La fosse Academy where we had to build a simple web application that displays a Pokedex, which consists of multiple Pokecard components. 

## Components
The app consists of two main components:

Pokedex Component: The parent component responsible for rendering the Pokedex. It creates and displays Pokecard components for each Pokemon. The Pokedex component manages the state and data for the Pokemon.

Pokecard Component: The child component that represents an individual Pokemon card. It receives props from the Pokedex component, such as the Pokemon's name, image, and type, and displays this information.

## Features

The Pokedex component renders a specific number of Pokecard components for each Pokemon in the Pokedex.
Each Pokecard component displays information about a Pokemon, including its name, image, and type.

## To run the Pokedex App locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/doheelee0328/react-pokemon-challenge.git
- Install dependencies: "npm install"
- Start the development server: "npm run dev"
- Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5173/ to view the app.
